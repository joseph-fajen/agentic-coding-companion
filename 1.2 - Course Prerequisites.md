Alright. 1 of the first things that I want to

00:02

knock out with you is installing all of the prerequisites

00:04

that you need for the entire agentic coding course. There's

00:08

only 6 things you need in total, and each 1

00:10

of them are pretty easy to install. So I'm not

00:13

gonna install anything from scratch here. I just wanted to

00:16

show you this guide that I'll have linked below

00:18

and walk you quickly through what you need to install

00:21

and why we need it. And then also, as a

00:23

couple of tips for you, I'll show you how we

00:25

can use AI coding assistance to help us with the

00:28

installation and verifying that we do have everything installed successfully.

00:32

And so the 6 things that we need. First of

00:34

all, we need Python. This is going to be the

00:37

primary programming language for our exercises into this course and

00:41

it is my favorite programming language.

00:44

Then also we need UV. This is how we manage

00:47

the external libraries we bring into Python.

00:49

We'll need Node. Js and NPM because we'll you be

00:52

using TypeScript for the front end for some exercises and

00:55

you can install both of those things together. And then

00:57

obviously, you will need an AI coding assistant. So I'm

01:01

using cloud code throughout this course.

01:04

But like I already said in the intro, I wanna

01:06

reemphasize this again. All the principles and systems that we

01:10

cover in this course will work no matter the AI

01:13

coding assistant that you use, and I'll be sure to

01:15

always cover that. So I just have installation instructions for

01:18

cloud code if you wanna use the same tool, but

01:21

it's very easy to install any of them. And then

01:24

you also will want an integrated development environment, an IDE.

01:28

This is your application for you to review the AI

01:31

generated code and to write anything yourself like documentation. That's

01:34

what I have open up right here. So I'm able

01:36

to view the folders that I have in the agent

01:39

decoding GitHub repository which is available for you and it

01:42

has nice formatting for our different files like Python scripts

01:45

and markdown documents. We definitely wanna have an IDE and

01:48

v s code is the 1 that I recommend.

01:51

And then last but not least you need git. This

01:53

is our way to version control our code so we

01:56

can keep track of versions and have backups and push

01:59

things remotely.

02:00

Git is your way to also access

02:03

this agentic coding course repository.

02:06

So get that installed and then once you have all

02:08

6 installed,

02:09

you can do a verification here. So there's a command

02:12

for each of the tools where you'll get a version

02:14

number back if you run each of these. So it's

02:16

just standard convention when you wanna verify an installation. You

02:19

just get the version in the command line. And we

02:22

can use AI coding assistance to help with all this

02:25

as well. For example, I'm gonna do control j here

02:28

to open up my terminal in my IDE.

02:31

That's how you do it in Versus code. And I

02:34

have my cloud code open up already. 1 thing I

02:36

can say is I can say read the read me

02:40

in,

02:40

and then I'm gonna grab this folder here

02:43

for the prereqs. So in at 2,

02:47

prereq setup guide. There we go. So read the read

02:50

me and then tell me for my operating system. So

02:54

it can even help you for your specific operating system

02:56

how to install

02:58

each of these things.

02:59

And so I can send in this request and this

03:02

is just 1 way to not have to read through

03:04

this entire read me. You can just give it to

03:06

your coding assistant and it'll tell you. So I just

03:08

paused and came back 10 seconds later and it gives

03:11

me the installation instructions for Windows specifically because that's where

03:15

I am. So like a PowerShell

03:17

specific command to install UV for example. And then I

03:20

can take this even further. I can not only have

03:22

it tell me how to verify,

03:24

but I can have it run the verification for me.

03:27

Take a look at this. Run the

03:29

verification

03:30

for all 6. Boom. Send this in and in just

03:33

a second, it's gonna run all 6 commands. And there

03:36

we go. So it ran all these in parallel. We

03:38

got the version for Python, UV,

03:40

node, NPM,

03:42

cloud code, Versus code, and git. And then we got

03:45

a nice table that it gave us at the end.

03:47

So we're already using AI coding assistance before we even

03:50

get into the code to help us with our prerequisites.

03:52

So we really are leveraging

03:54

AI for everything. So that's all I got for prerequisites.

03:58

If there's any issues that you have installing anything,

04:01

always please feel free to post a question in the

04:03

DynaMed community. Again, there is a dedicated portion of our

04:07

community, a dedicated category

04:09

for the agentic coding course. And you can always check

04:12

the official documentation and have your coding assistant point you

04:15

to that as well. So you've got what you need

04:18

to take care of this once you have the prerequisites

04:21

installed.

04:21

Now we can go on to 1 more thing that

04:24

I wanna cover before we get to our first exercise.

04:26

So I'll see you in the next video on the

04:28

system gap deep dive.
