Welcome to your module 3 exercise.

00:02

Your job here is to clean up a bloated global

00:06

rule file. And so there's gonna be 3 categories that

00:10

each of the sections fall into. It either should stay

00:13

in the global rules, it should be auto loaded. It

00:16

should be split out into on demand context or a

00:19

reference document,

00:20

or it's redundant and we should remove it. And so

00:22

you'll go through each section of the global rules for

00:25

this exercise

00:27

and it categorize them. And then at the end of

00:29

this video, I'll go through my solution as well. And

00:32

so the global rules that we have for this exercise

00:34

is actually the rules for the Obsidian agent that we're

00:37

gonna really start to build together in the 2 modules

00:40

from now.

00:41

And Rasmus and I are perfectionists. We're gonna keep improving

00:44

these global rules throughout the course, but this is generally

00:46

what it's going to look like in all of the

00:48

core sections that we have. However, these global rules, take

00:52

a look at this. If I scroll down to the

00:53

bottom, it is 600 lines long. Definitely too long for

00:58

a global rules file. There's some things that are redundant,

01:01

and then also some sections here that can definitely be

01:04

split out in on demand context because it only applies

01:07

to specific task types, and that's your job to figure

01:10

this out. And so I have the folder for the

01:13

exercise in the repo that I'll link to below. So

01:16

you can go into here. We've got the read me

01:18

that has the instructions for the exercise and then also

01:20

the global rules for you to work with. And then

01:22

I have the solution folder, which don't open this yet.

01:24

Right? Because even just looking at how I split things

01:27

out into on demand context will give away the solution.

01:30

So don't look in here yet. I want you to

01:32

take this global rule

01:34

and then apply the 2 question framework to each section

01:37

to figure out where it belongs. And so very simply,

01:40

first question you you want to ask yourself for each

01:42

section

01:43

is is this constant

01:45

a stable and reusable piece of context or is it

01:49

task specific?

01:51

If it is constant, then go to question 2.

01:54

If it is task specific, that means that it doesn't

01:56

belong in the global rules at all because remember,

01:59

global rules and on demand context, that is layer 1

02:02

planning. When you are task specific,

02:05

that's when we go to layer 2 planning.

02:07

And then for question number 2, when we are applying

02:10

just the layer 1, is it needed every session or

02:14

is it task type specific?

02:16

If yes, it is needed every session, then it goes

02:19

in the global rules. You'd mark it as it should

02:21

stay in auto loaded context. Otherwise, it is load on

02:24

demand and we should split it out into a reference

02:26

document. So go through the global rules here, apply that

02:29

2 question framework to every section, figure out what's redundant,

02:33

what should be split out, and what should stay. And

02:35

you can document your analysis however you want, but I

02:38

do have a little template here if you want to

02:40

follow. You can create 3 lists and just a new

02:42

markdown file called your analysis. So all the sections that

02:45

you think should keep in the global rules, like you

02:47

want to auto load it into each session, what you

02:50

want to split out into on demand, loan when needed,

02:52

and then what you think is redundant,

02:55

or just anything that we should remove entirely because it

02:58

is task specific. So there you go. Got some hints

03:01

and thinking prompts to help you go through this if

03:03

you want. Otherwise, you can go ahead and knock this

03:05

out now, and then I will come back with the

03:08

solutions. So pause the video right now. Go do the

03:11

exercise,

03:12

then come back to this time because right when I

03:14

come back here, I'm gonna be going through the solution.

03:16

Okay. So welcome back. I hope you had a chance

03:19

to do the exercise and it all made sense to

03:21

you. So now, I wanna cover my solution, which I

03:24

wanna be very clear upfront. There isn't necessarily

03:28

a right answer.

03:29

What I'm giving you right here is just a suggested

03:32

categorization.

03:33

A lot of these sections are debatable, and we're adding

03:35

this gray area in on purpose because I want you

03:38

to think of it more as a thinking exercise. It's

03:41

the thinking process that matters

03:43

more than getting the perfect categorization. Because even working on

03:46

a real code base, it's okay if you have a

03:48

little bit of what should be on demand context in

03:51

your global rules. It doesn't hurt that much unless you

03:54

have a lot of that. So it's important for you

03:56

to try your best, but it doesn't need to be

03:59

perfect.

04:00

And so first of all, what I have in auto

04:02

load, what I'm keeping in my global rules, it really

04:05

is most of the sections

04:07

that you saw. The project overview,

04:09

core principles, architecture, logging rules, documentation style. These are the

04:12

things that are going to apply to every session. It

04:15

doesn't matter if we're fixing a bug, we're starting the

04:18

code base from scratch, we're adding a new feature, we

04:20

care about our logging rules and documentation

04:22

style as an example.

04:24

The main thing that I'm moving to on demand context,

04:28

the biggest bloat that we have

04:30

is the guide on how to build tools for our

04:32

AI agent. And there is a little bit of an

04:35

Easter egg actually in our Excalidraw diagram. When I gave

04:38

the example of as needed

04:40

context,

04:41

it was this guide on how to build tools into

04:43

an AI agent. So maybe you caught that and that

04:46

helped you through the exercise. We left that in there

04:48

on purpose. I thought it was pretty cool. So, yeah,

04:50

that's the main thing. It's 400 lines. And so even

04:52

though there's only a couple of sections that we're taking

04:55

out of our global rules to move to on demand,

04:57

our global rules in the solution

05:00

is only a hundred and 66 lines. And then the

05:03

1 that you have for the exercise was 600 lines.

05:06

So a lot more concise thanks to moving quite a

05:09

bit over to our on demand context. The other thing

05:12

I added to on demand is adding feature processes. So

05:15

I have in the reference document,

05:17

or in the reference folder, I have the adding tools

05:20

guide and then the adding features guide. Right? Because this

05:22

isn't gonna apply to when we're working on bug fixes,

05:24

for example. Adding features, it's a pretty broad task type,

05:28

but it is a task type. And this honestly is

05:30

something that is pretty debatable,

05:32

especially because of how broad of a task type this

05:35

is. But again, gray area, it's totally up to you.

05:38

And so maybe you included

05:40

the adding feature process in the global rule still. That's

05:43

totally okay.

05:45

This is just an example. And then as far as

05:47

what's redundant, there's just 1 little thing here for the

05:49

AI agent notes at the end of the global rules.

05:51

It's very much duplicate information from the logging rule section.

05:55

So it's only 10 lines, but it's just the principle

05:57

that I'm trying to show here is, like, you just

05:59

wanna make sure you don't have duplicate information that's bloating

06:02

your context,

06:03

for no reason at all. So there you go. That's

06:06

the exercise. I hope that this really helps solidify in

06:09

your mind how to think about what to put in

06:11

your global rules, what to put in your on demand

06:14

context, and then also what to save for layer 2

06:17

for the very task specific type planning.

06:20

And so feel free to share your solution for the

06:23

exercise in the community as well. And then with that,

06:25

we're going on to module 4. Module 4, we are

06:29

going to be covering commands or reusable prompts, which I'm

06:32

very excited for because the commands are probably the most

06:35

core part of any system that we can build for

06:37

our AI coding assistance, and they also help us work

06:40

with our layer 1 on demand context

06:43

and starting to really get into layer 2 and building

06:45

commands for things like planning and implementing and committing our

06:49

changes. Very exciting. So I will see you in the

06:51

next module for that.
