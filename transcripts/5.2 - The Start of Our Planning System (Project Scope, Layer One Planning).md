So now we are gonna be building the Obsidian AI

00:02

agent completely from scratch together. So I can show you

00:05

planning in action and how we systematize it. So I

00:09

will be completely

00:10

scrapping what we built together in the module 2. I

00:14

wanted to have that template because it's easier to build

00:16

on top of a code base to demonstrate the PIV

00:19

loop for the first time. Remember,

00:21

progression of complexity.

00:23

But now we will be creating the agent from scratch.

00:26

And even if you're working on something else, not the

00:28

Obsidian agent, you can still learn from the full process

00:31

that I go through here. This is going to apply

00:33

no matter what you create. You can get a sense

00:35

of my thought process as I'm doing things with you

00:38

here for our planning and then going into the implementation

00:41

and validation.

00:43

And so for this video, we're gonna be starting by

00:45

creating our PRD or product requirements document. This is the

00:50

highest level document that outlines the full scope of work

00:54

for the MVP of our application.

00:56

And your PRD is the last part of layer 1

00:59

planning that we haven't really covered yet. So we've covered

01:02

our rules, we've covered our on demand context, and by

01:05

the way, creating a PRD can help you build your

01:08

rules and on demand context as well. We'll talk about

01:11

that later too. But, yeah, our layer 1 planning, again,

01:13

is everything done once and updated rarely.

01:16

And our PRD is the highest level document outlining our

01:20

project. And you can kind of think of it as

01:22

part of our as needed context because we're going to

01:25

create this scope of work that we will reference

01:28

constantly

01:29

as we're going through the different PIV loops to implement

01:31

things. And so for example, when you're going through 1

01:34

PIV loop, you might look at the PRD to see

01:36

like what's the next logical feature to build into the

01:38

code base based on this, you know, final scope of

01:41

work that I wanna have for the MVP.

01:44

And a very important thing that I want to stress

01:46

here,

01:47

I cannot forget this, it is super important

01:50

to not take your PRD

01:53

and try to use that as your structure plan to

01:55

knock everything out in a single PIV loop. Unless you

01:58

have a very simple

02:00

project, you are going to get bad results. AI coding

02:03

assistant is going to be completely overwhelmed if you take

02:05

the full scope of work and send that into implementation

02:08

right away.

02:09

And I mentioned this because it's kind of tempting to

02:12

try to do so. And you'll see this in this

02:15

module

02:16

that we go through vibe planning. We create a structured

02:19

plan to build our PRD. It's very similar to the

02:22

start of a PIV loop, but this is not a

02:25

document

02:25

to be sent right into implementation. Again, we're going to

02:28

be referencing it as needed

02:30

to think about, like, how do we start our project,

02:33

what's the next feature we should build, and then we

02:35

do a smaller PIV loop to implement just part of

02:38

what we're outlining in the PRD. And so with that,

02:41

let's go ahead and create it together. So as promised,

02:44

we are now in a completely

02:46

empty repository. I have wiped the main branch

02:50

of our Obsidian AI agent repo. I have everything for

02:53

module 2 stashed in a different branch, but I wiped

02:56

main on purpose because I really do want to show

02:59

that we're building things throughout this course from scratch together.

03:02

And so right now we'll create our PRD,

03:04

then we'll bring in the template and we'll bring in

03:06

some of our rules and commands that we built in

03:08

the last couple of modules. We're tying everything together, putting

03:11

a nice bow on it. It is beautiful, but we

03:13

really are starting

03:14

from scratch here. And so I'm within my cloud code

03:17

now. This can be obviously any AI coding assistant like

03:20

I've been stressing, and we're gonna start by just basically

03:23

doing some vibe planning. Like I said, it's going to

03:26

look very similar to what we have at the start

03:29

of a PIV loop because we're just gonna explore some

03:31

ideas around this project we want to create, start to

03:34

define our architecture and tech stack, which like I said

03:37

earlier will also help us build the rest of our

03:39

layer 1 like our global rules. So making it even

03:42

easier for you in this module

03:44

to think about how we create our global rules and

03:47

on demand context. And so right now, I just want

03:49

to think at a high level. I want you to

03:51

think at a high level. What do you want to

03:53

build? Right? And it can start with just a very

03:55

simple request to start to do some research to create

03:59

our scope of work. And so in my case,

04:02

very simply, I want to build an AI agent that

04:04

can help me navigate and manage my Obsidian Vault. And

04:07

at this point, I don't even have to think about

04:09

what capabilities I want the agent to have in particular.

04:12

I mean, I kinda know at a high level that

04:14

I want it to manage files and folders and help

04:16

me edit and append to files, but I don't even

04:19

have to worry about that that much. And so I

04:21

have this very unstructured

04:23

prompt crafted already that I'm just gonna paste in, help

04:26

me research this project I wanna build. Send out some

04:28

agents on tasks to help me paralyze the research, which

04:31

this isn't super crucial. If you're using a coding assistant

04:33

that can't paralyze tasks like cloud code can, it it's

04:36

totally good. And, yeah, here's where I describe my project.

04:39

I wanna build a custom AI agent. I can operate

04:41

on my Obsidian Vault. And there's a couple of of

04:43

technologies

04:44

that I already know I want to include. So we

04:46

talked about this in module 3 when you're creating your

04:48

rules, same thing when you're creating your PRD. You wanna

04:51

think about the tech stack you know already, and if

04:54

you're not comfortable yet, then you don't have to mention

04:56

anything and you can just do research with the coding

04:58

assistant to find what is optimal for you. And so

05:01

as a vault user, I wanna be able to interact

05:03

with my vault with natural language

05:05

and then listing the tech stack again just in a

05:08

bit more detail. And then also I wanna use an

05:10

existing Obsidian plugin to connect to my agent. So I'm

05:13

not building any kind of front end or Obsidian plugin.

05:16

I'm just building the AI agent and then we're going

05:18

to incorporate that into the Copilot plugin that I demonstrated

05:22

for you in module 2. And so my request at

05:25

first, because it really is just vibe planning here, is

05:28

help me research this project for feasibility,

05:30

gathering context around how we can achieve this build. And

05:33

I probably could have worded things a lot better. I

05:36

mentioned the tech stack in multiple places, like it's not

05:39

the perfect prompt, but that's the point. Like I did

05:41

that on purpose to show you here that it's very

05:44

free form

05:45

at this point. And I know that I've said this

05:48

a lot already, but that is how it is in

05:50

our vibe planning stage. And so we are going to

05:53

get to the point where things are a lot more

05:55

structured when we have our final PRD after we are

05:58

on the same page with a coding assistant on the

06:01

scope of work for our MVP.

06:03

Alright. So we're back, and it finished all of its

06:05

research. This is 1 of the things I love with

06:07

Cloud Code where it can kick off these tasks or

06:09

these sub agents in parallel to do a lot of

06:12

research and then just return a summary to me here.

06:15

So definitely don't need that, but it's just helpful here.

06:17

And so there we go. Feasibility assessment. This is highly

06:20

feasible. It did research on all the different parts of

06:23

the stack that I mentioned, and, yeah, it absolutely loves

06:26

it. This is good. And it even outlines an entire

06:28

architecture, which I don't care too much about this at

06:31

this point. But it is nice that it does already

06:34

start to form these ideas for how it wants to

06:37

build this, then I can validate that myself, ask it

06:39

questions where I need to. I'm not going to show

06:42

this a ton right now because I want to have

06:44

a good balance of, like, being thorough with you here,

06:47

but also rather brief. And so I'll just say that,

06:49

like, here is also a good place to ask some

06:51

of your initial questions if you're still working through the

06:54

tech stack or you're curious anything that outputted here, if

06:56

you just, like, have questions like why do you have

06:59

this as your sample project structure, for example. So ask

07:02

as much as you need. You probably will be spending

07:05

more time going through this than I'm doing for you

07:07

just in the video right now. And so, yeah, just

07:09

I'm gonna say this research looks good. I agree with

07:11

most of the things here. Again, continue to have an

07:14

unstructured conversation. Now the next line is pretty interesting because

07:17

I'm referencing a plugin that I want to use. So

07:20

I'm injecting

07:21

yet another idea into the coding assistant from my own

07:24

research. I'm saying that for the Copilot

07:26

plug in specifically, I wanna use this 1. I gave

07:28

it a link so it can understand

07:30

what the plug in is, how it works, how it

07:32

might need to build the agent to work with it.

07:34

And so as much as you can, remember, we want

07:37

to reduce the assumptions

07:39

that the AI coding assistant is making. And so when

07:41

we have ideas of our tech stack already

07:43

or how we want to structure things like I have

07:46

for our architecture

07:47

or the tools that we wanna integrate with, give those

07:50

right away. You want to include that in the PRD.

07:53

And if you're unsure of these things, like, you don't

07:55

know what the architecture looks like yet, or you don't

07:58

have an opinion of the tools you're going to be

08:00

leveraging,

08:01

this is again where you can ask the coding assistant

08:04

to research ideas, give you options to pick from with

08:06

pros and cons, have that conversation as much as you

08:09

need. And so I'm showing you what it looks like

08:11

from a bit more of an experienced engineer perspective when

08:13

I have ideas of like, yeah, I wanna use UV

08:16

by astral.

08:17

I have an idea of the architecture I want for

08:20

the tools for the agent. This kind of thing I

08:23

already know from what I've done before. So I'm leveraging

08:25

my existing knowledge and my research as much as possible

08:29

to reduce assumptions, but this doesn't have to be that

08:33

detailed. If you want to leave more things up to

08:35

the coding assistant, it's okay.

08:37

Just always nice to be specific where possible. So I'll

08:40

go ahead and send this in and just continue the

08:43

conversation getting on the same page with our PRD. Alright.

08:46

So we're back, and the coding assistant actually had a

08:48

couple of misunderstandings.

08:50

And, obviously, I've sent in these exact same prompts to

08:52

testings before recording here to make sure that it's relatively

08:55

smooth. I've never seen this before, but this is good.

08:58

I I wanna cover, like, some of the hiccups that

09:00

you can have live and how we have to clarify

09:03

some misconception that it has. So, for example, I said

09:05

that I wanna have my py project dot toml within

09:08

the app folder, and it thought that I meant that

09:10

this is some folder within our project root, but I

09:14

actually meant app to be the project root. So I

09:16

just need to clarify that really quickly. And then also

09:19

another thing is it's asking, do I want option a,

09:22

a single AI agent with a bunch of tools, or

09:25

do I wanna do a multi agent architecture? So I

09:27

have an agent for the search stuff and an agent

09:29

for the note specific stuff, which that is definitely over

09:33

engineering and it does recognize that. It says my recommendation

09:35

is to start with option a. And so yeah I'm

09:38

just gonna go down the the prompt here and type

09:40

out,

09:41

you misunderstood.

09:44

I meant app

09:46

to be the project root.

09:48

Also, yes. Definitely,

09:50

option a.

09:53

Only want a single agent. So I'm just kinda showing

09:55

you ad hoc here correcting a couple of its misconceptions.

09:58

I don't even know why it considered multi agent, but

10:01

yeah, now we'll be good to go. So I could

10:03

have just, like, cut this out and come back and

10:05

said, like, this is what I have to do, but

10:06

I just wanna give you, even though these are kind

10:08

of random examples, I wanna give you an example of

10:10

how you just need to put in the effort to

10:13

get on the same page with the coding assistant,

10:15

clear up any misconceptions

10:16

that both it might have and also what you might

10:19

have. Keep asking questions

10:21

until you're very confident. Alright. So it looks like the

10:24

clarification was made very clearly to the coding assistant.

10:27

Everything is looking a lot better, and we're doing a

10:29

single agent as well. So good. Now we're good to

10:32

move on to the next thing. So I'm just gonna

10:34

go ahead and paste another unstructured prompt here. So just

10:37

in this case, I wanna think now about what capabilities

10:40

I wanna give to the Obsidian agent.

10:43

And this is another good example of standing on the

10:46

shoulder of giants. I'm going to be leveraging

10:49

this Obsidian MCP server that I've done my own research

10:53

to find

10:54

as an example of good tools, good capabilities to build

10:58

into our agent. So I'm not gonna be leveraging this

11:01

MCP exactly. I wanna build my own tools to really

11:04

be flexible,

11:05

but I can use this as a resource

11:08

as I'm going through the PRD creation here. Maybe even

11:12

referencing this again in the first PIV loop, who knows?

11:14

But like using this as sort of my, as sort

11:17

of part of my on demand context really. I'm gonna

11:20

reference this to look at the different tools that it

11:22

implements in the MCP

11:24

using those ideas for myself.

11:27

And so I say here there's an existing Obsidian MCP

11:29

server that has a set of tools built out. So

11:31

research what type of tools the server has, what capabilities,

11:35

and then apply it to my code base. Give the

11:37

recommendation for a tool set for the MVP

11:40

using this and then any other reasoning it wants. Like,

11:42

maybe I want more than just what's here as well,

11:44

but this is part of the context now, thinking about

11:47

the capabilities we want for our agents. So I'm gonna

11:49

go ahead and send this in.

11:52

And so you don't have to be referencing these kinds

11:55

of resources. If you do want to just think from

11:57

scratch what makes sense working with Obsidian, you definitely can,

12:01

but it's just really nice to lean on these resources.

12:03

And you'll see that a lot throughout the next few

12:06

modules, even some other things like our guide to building

12:08

tools, for example, that we covered in the last couple

12:11

of modules. Well, I actually built that thanks to an

12:14

article from Anthropic on best practices for building tools. We'll

12:17

see that as well. Alright. The research has finished. It

12:20

lists out all the tools in that Obsidian MCP, and

12:22

and then the rest of the text here is really

12:24

just the tools it recommends based on that for our

12:27

MVP here, which I appreciate that. There's a lot of

12:30

advice that I'm getting from the coding assistant already, but

12:33

it's probably more generic advice. LLMs are very helpful for

12:37

planning, but also their advice is generic a lot of

12:40

the times. And so I don't necessarily know if this

12:42

really is the best way to structure the tools that

12:45

we're thinking about together here. And so just like I

12:48

leaned on an additional resource to think about what tools

12:51

to incorporate,

12:52

I should also lean on some expert guidance for how

12:56

to structure my tools. And that's what I wanna keep

12:58

hammering in time and time again for you here, both

13:00

for creating our PRDs

13:02

and in the planning in the PIV loop is we

13:04

want to lean on expertise

13:06

as much as we possibly can. LLMs are only part

13:09

of the expertise that you should lean on. And so

13:11

I did some research and I found this absolutely fantastic

13:15

article by Anthropic that I'll link to below. It's their

13:18

guide on writing effective tools for AI agents, even using

13:22

AI coding assistance to help us build these tools.

13:25

Honestly, even if you're not building the Obsidian AI agent

13:27

with me live right now, like, you should still read

13:30

this article. It's fantastic.

13:31

And And so a lot of different advice for how

13:33

to build effective tools.

13:35

1 thing that it says here that actually pretty much

13:38

directly goes against what the LLM is recommending

13:41

is that we want to instead of trying to build

13:44

a lot of different tools, which is very token costly,

13:47

It recommends building a few thoughtful tools targeting specific high

13:51

impact workflows. Like what's the flow that our agent is

13:54

going to be going through a lot to help us

13:57

manage things in Obsidian.

13:58

So instead of basically creating a tool for every little

14:01

API operation like reading, creating, appending, updating, we should be

14:05

a lot more thoughtful creating less tools overall. And so

14:08

that's what I'm gonna do here. I'm gonna paste in

14:10

another prompt and, yeah, you found some truly valuable tools

14:13

and use cases. Like, it it did do a good

14:15

job overall.

14:17

However, there's 1 thing that I don't like. Instead of

14:19

building 1 tool per operation, we should group tools together.

14:23

Focus on high impact workflows,

14:25

focus on making things more token efficient and less overwhelming

14:28

for our agent.

14:30

And so I'm pasting in the article right here so

14:32

that it'll read this directly and just absorb all of

14:36

this expertise for the recommendations here as it's helping us

14:38

create our PRD.

14:40

And so there's a lot of text here, a lot

14:42

of my own opinion that I'm injecting in, but if

14:45

you're less comfortable with this, it could be as simple

14:47

as just pasting in this article and say, like, read

14:49

the guide here, then rethink how we would structure our

14:53

tools, for example. And I'm using the special keyword here,

14:56

ultra think, which it's actually very cool. In cloud code,

14:59

it highlights it a different color because this is actually

15:02

a special word that triggers deeper thinking within the LLM

15:06

powering cloud code. So it's going to ultra think about

15:09

the guide here and then think about how to design

15:12

the tools better. So I'm gonna go ahead and send

15:14

this in. I'm also asking for its thought and what

15:17

it thinks about the best approach. And so it's gonna

15:18

be it's going to give me some different options to

15:20

pick from as well. Alright. So it read through the

15:23

article and it ultra thought through it, and it's looking

15:27

really good now. So it gave a couple of different

15:29

options for us, like I said it would. The first

15:32

option is to have 3 core tools. And so, yeah,

15:35

it is simplifying things based on the guidance from Anthropic.

15:38

So we have 1 tool to do the discovery and

15:41

search in our vault,

15:43

1 to manage things like moving files and editing folder

15:47

names, all that, and another to get specific context workflow

15:51

oriented reads. This is looking really, really good. And there's

15:54

another option it has with 4 tools as well. I'm

15:56

not gonna cover this in a lot of detail because

15:58

it's not extremely interesting. In the end, it at the

16:01

bottom here recommends 3 tools option a, and I definitely

16:05

agree. And so I'm gonna send in the next prompt

16:07

here. Great. I like recommended option a, having more things

16:10

in the bulk. And then also, please create an MVP

16:13

tool design markdown document to store option a and the

16:16

reasoning. We don't even have to include the second option

16:19

it gave here. And the reason I'm doing this

16:22

is because this markdown document is going to be a

16:25

part of our layer 1 planning. It is a part

16:27

of our on demand context. It's very similar

16:31

to our markdown document for our guide on building tools

16:35

that we talked about in the last couple of modules.

16:37

I'll probably end up using that instead of this, but

16:39

I'm just demonstrating here that, like, as we're planning our

16:42

PRD or doing research on things, it's also an opportunity

16:45

to extract insights from the conversation

16:48

into documents that we'll reference later for creating tools, fixing

16:52

bugs, like whatever we're doing research on with our AI

16:55

coding assistant.

16:56

And so I wanna stress this again, working through your

16:59

PRD is actually quite helpful

17:01

for creating your rules and your on demand context because

17:05

this conversation is so rich

17:07

with insights that we have given the coding assistant and

17:10

that it has given us through its own research.

17:13

Alright. It has now finished the first part of the

17:15

layer 1 planning that we have created for real together

17:18

with this build. And I always recommend going through these

17:20

markdown documents

17:22

and cleaning things up, validating things. Coding assistants love to

17:25

be way too verbose. For example, I already looked at

17:28

this off camera, and I know that a lot of

17:29

these things at the bottom, we definitely don't need. And

17:32

so, yeah, typically, you'll clean up things at the bottom,

17:34

by the way. Just a little golden nugget for you

17:37

here. But, yeah, just for the sake of wanting to

17:39

move on here, I'll just assume that everything else is

17:41

good. This is some context now that we can leverage.

17:43

Every time we build tools as a part of a

17:46

PIV loop, we can look at this and we can

17:47

include this document in some of our commands, like a

17:50

build tool command, for example. So we'll leverage this going

17:54

forward. And so the next thing that I want to

17:56

do is create my PRD.

17:59

Your conversation might be a lot longer before you get

18:01

to the point where you're ready, but I'm just going

18:03

to assume now that I'm ready to create my product

18:06

requirement document. I know what I wanna build for the

18:09

agent. I know the plugin that I'm gonna be working

18:11

with in Obsidian. I know the tools that I wanna

18:13

give my agent. I think I'm pretty ready here. So

18:15

I've got a prompt already crafted here. Pretty nice and

18:18

simple though. I'm asking it to create a p r

18:20

d dot m d. So this is gonna be basically

18:22

then second markdown document we create for our layer 1

18:25

planning. And then the next couple of videos will bring

18:27

in other commands and and rules and things like that.

18:29

And so I wanted to outline the executive summary, mission,

18:32

target users, MVP scope, core patterns, tools for the agent.

18:36

This is pretty flexible. Like, you can define whatever you

18:38

want here. It's kind of like a structured plan for

18:41

the PIV loop where you get to define the sections

18:43

for yourself. So I want it to be a well

18:45

structured markdown document with headers and sub headers and asking

18:48

it to keep it concise because LLMs are often way

18:51

too verbose.

18:52

And then here's another awesome thing that I like to

18:54

include. Whenever I get to the point where I'm ready

18:56

to create my PRD or create my structure plan, if

19:00

I'm not entirely

19:01

confident

19:02

that the coding assistant and I are on the same

19:04

page and it's ready to just run with creating the

19:06

PRD,

19:07

I will ask it to ask me clarifying questions

19:11

if it needs to before it creates the PRD. And

19:14

so if you're ever unsure, like, is it time to

19:16

actually do it? Just add this and it's a bit

19:18

of a safety here. It's not gonna be perfect. Like,

19:21

maybe you really do need to have a bit of

19:22

a longer conversation first, but it helps catch any of

19:25

those other things that the coding assistant realizes

19:27

we haven't talked about yet, like security or deployment, you

19:30

know, something like that. Alright. So it asks a lot

19:33

of pretty good clarifying questions, maybe more than I really

19:35

care.

19:36

Some things like,

19:38

timeline and success criteria

19:40

that I don't really need in my PRD right now,

19:42

but, yeah, overall, it's good to just answer these questions.

19:45

And then to be totally honest, sometimes, like, for a

19:47

timeline, I don't really care about that for my PRD.

19:50

I just say NA. Like, it's fine. You don't have

19:52

to answer all these questions, but it is just good

19:54

to clarify things for the coding assistant, and it'll help

19:56

you realize if there's something that you need to cover

19:58

in the conversation

20:00

before we create our PRD. But, yeah, I answered those

20:02

questions, and then it went ahead and created our PRD.

20:05

And so just like with structured plans, I covered this

20:08

in the PIV loop, you want to go through each

20:10

of the core sections here, and this is gonna look

20:13

pretty similar to a structured plan. This is just a

20:15

higher level scope document. Just go through and validate these

20:19

things. Make sure that it's aligned with what you actually

20:21

want to build. And so I'm not gonna show that

20:23

in detail here, but definitely I'll have at least a

20:25

couple of iterations usually to

20:27

simplify things, make sure that there's no information that is

20:31

missing, or if there's any kind of just little details

20:34

that I wanna correct because this is going to be

20:36

a document along with our global rules and on demand

20:39

context that really guides our entire implementation. So it is

20:42

important to get this right, make sure that you understand

20:46

everything that was produced here, and then it makes sense

20:48

for you. For example, as far as refining our PRD,

20:52

I wanted to clarify some things about how Docker works

20:55

for the agent. So I could tell going through it

20:56

that I didn't quite understand things. Specifically, how we're mounting

20:59

the Obsidian Vault into the Docker container where our AI

21:03

agent is running. And then I also forgot to tell

21:06

it that we're giving our agent a name. It's gonna

21:08

be called a Patty. So there we go. This just

21:10

a simple of example of some refinements to our PRD.

21:13

It made all those changes here, and you might do

21:16

this quite a few times, but right now I'm gonna

21:18

say that we are good to go. So that is

21:20

everything for creating our PRD. And I know this was

21:22

a longer video, but it's just so important to when

21:25

we're doing a greenfield project, starting something from scratch, maybe

21:29

create this high level scope of work that's going to

21:31

guide everything going forward. Every single PIV loop is going

21:35

to be based on something that we have specified in

21:38

this PRD generally.

21:40

And so, yeah, with that, we'll go on to the

21:41

next couple of videos where we will incorporate that template

21:44

that I was talking about and bring in some of

21:47

our rules and commands that we covered in the last

21:49

couple of modules. So I'll see you in the next

21:51

video for that.
