Welcome to module 5 of the DynaMed agentic coding course.

00:04

This is all about systems for planning.

00:07

And so at this point, we've covered rules and commands,

00:10

layer 1 planning, layer 2 planning. You actually already saw

00:12

layer 2 planning in action when we went through the

00:15

PIV loop the first time, at least at a high

00:17

level in module 2. And so now what I wanna

00:20

do with you over the next few modules is really

00:22

bring things together. How can we take our rules, on

00:25

demand context, commands, all these things that we've created and

00:29

actually apply it to the PIV loop. So over the

00:31

next few modules, we're gonna be going through the PIV

00:33

loop quite a few times because it's always optimal to

00:36

do smaller iterations. Right? We don't want to do too

00:39

much at once. I'm gonna demonstrate exactly what that looks

00:42

like and how we can apply everything we learned to

00:44

the last couple of modules. Now before we even get

00:47

into systems for planning, I wanted to dedicate this video

00:50

for getting on the same page with you for how

00:52

our course is structured for the next few modules and

00:55

why that is the case. You have no idea how

00:58

much mental effort Rasmus and I have been putting into

01:01

optimizing the structure of things for you, especially considering you

01:05

might be brand new to AI coding or you might

01:07

be pretty experienced already. We have both of those tracks

01:09

in mind here. And so I'm in the first Excalidraw

01:13

that we had as the intro to this course. I

01:14

wanna go back over to our schedule to talk about

01:17

this a little bit. And by the way, some of

01:19

the ordering of things might change in the future here,

01:21

but we're very solidified on the content that we are

01:24

covering. And And so, yeah. Right now, I wanna talk

01:26

about the next few modules and then especially how they

01:29

relate to the live workshop that we've got coming up

01:32

next for the course. Now the thing I really wanna

01:34

get across here is that we have structured this course

01:37

to be a progression

01:38

of complexity

01:39

for you going through the material

01:41

versus a progression of the order that you would do

01:44

things when you're starting a project from scratch. And so

01:47

in this module, when we cover systems for planning, we're

01:50

going to finish up layer 1 planning. We're gonna create

01:53

a high level PRD that is our project scope for

01:56

our MVP, and then we are going to be basically

01:59

building the foundation of our Obsidian AI agent from scratch.

02:03

However,

02:04

we are gonna be working off of a template that

02:06

I'll show you how to build in the next workshop

02:10

for the course. That is this guy right here. I

02:12

already have this published. I'll have it linked below for

02:15

you to check out. It is a fast API and

02:17

postgreSQL

02:18

template that we're gonna be building our Obsidian AI agent

02:22

on top of. And so this, and I'll show you

02:25

how to build this in the workshop here, is a

02:27

code base that is optimized for working with AI coding

02:31

assistance specifically. And I highly recommend as much as you

02:33

can to start your projects building on top of these

02:36

kinds of templates that you can build for yourself, and

02:39

that's what I'm gonna show you how to do in

02:41

this workshop. And so when I go through this module,

02:43

I am going to be treating it as creating a

02:46

project from scratch, just leveraging this code base as a

02:50

launching pad. You definitely don't need that for yourself. So

02:53

even if you do start completely from scratch, everything that

02:56

I cover in module 5 will apply.

02:58

But I want to do this later on because creating

03:01

an optimized code base for AI coding is a more

03:05

advanced topic. So I wanna go through showing you the

03:08

PIV loop in action with all of the systems we've

03:11

started to create in the last couple of modules.

03:13

Then I'll show you how we can create these kinds

03:15

of templates because they're not a requirement even though they

03:17

are very, very powerful, just more advanced.

03:20

That's why I'm doing it in this order. And so

03:22

I wanted to spend a couple minutes to explain that

03:24

so you understand why it might feel like we're jumping

03:26

around a little bit here, but we are basically starting

03:30

from scratch. I'll even show you how we can incorporate

03:33

the template

03:34

in 1 of the next videos in this module to

03:37

use that as our starting point.

03:39

And so again, progression of complexity.

03:42

Remember, in the first release block, this was the fundamentals,

03:45

understanding the PIV loop at the highest level possible.

03:48

Now we started to define our system with our rules

03:51

and our on demand context and our commands. And now

03:53

we're gonna see that in action with multiple pivot loops

03:56

in the next few modules,

03:57

how we can create systems around the different parts of

04:00

the pivot loop, and then also some strategies for evolving

04:03

our systems. You'll see a lot more of that module

04:05

6 especially.

04:06

And then in the next release block, this is when

04:08

we start to automate our systems with some more command

04:11

chaining like that bonus video you saw in the last

04:14

module. We'll talk about doing things in GitHub and remote

04:17

agent decoding. I've got some awesome resources for you here.

04:20

And so again, just leveling up the complexity over time

04:23

as we're going through these modules. So I hope that

04:26

makes sense.

04:27

And with that, let's go ahead and kick things off

04:30

in module 5 here. We're gonna be starting from a

04:33

completely blank slate to generating the last part of our

04:36

layer 1 context, which is our PRD. It's a top

04:39

level scope for our project.

04:41

Then we will bring in the template and bring in

04:44

the global rules and commands that we've built in the

04:46

last couple of modules, and then we'll be off to

04:48

the races doing the PIV loop for the first time

04:51

creating our project basically from scratch.
