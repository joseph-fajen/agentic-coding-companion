Alright. The last thing I wanna cover before we really

00:02

get into systematizing our planning is I wanna get our

00:05

template set up. This is the launching pad for the

00:08

beginning of our Obsidian AI agent that I talked about

00:10

a couple of videos ago. And so right now, I'll

00:13

show you how to get this template set up. And

00:15

then in the next video, we'll incorporate some of the

00:18

rules and commands

00:19

that we created in modules 3 and 4 into this

00:22

template. And then all that with our PRD we created

00:24

in the last video is gonna come together to create

00:27

our layer 1 planning. That'll be everything, and then we'll

00:30

get into the first PIV loop in the next video

00:33

as well. And then in the next workshop for the

00:35

community, I know I mentioned this already, but super important,

00:38

that's where I'll show you how to build this kind

00:40

of template. So I'll cover building this and how it

00:43

applies to really any template that you could create as

00:46

a starting point for your specific project. And as a

00:48

part of DynaVista, I love to create more templates like

00:51

this as well that is in the plans. And so

00:53

no matter the project you wanna create, like a front

00:55

end with TypeScript or an agent with Python, you have

00:58

a starting point that is optimized

01:00

for AI coding assistance. And trust me, Rasmus especially, he

01:04

we both put a lot of work into optimizing this

01:07

for AI coding assistance with the infrastructure and tech stack

01:10

and logging and configuration, all the best practices that are

01:12

baked into this. And so this template is not a

01:15

requirement to start a project, but it definitely is going

01:17

to get us to having our complete MVP faster. And

01:21

it's very easy to incorporate this template for yourself. Literally,

01:25

all you have to do, it it actually is set

01:26

up as something called a template in GitHub. You can

01:29

click on use this template in the top right, and

01:31

then you select the owner, which I just have this

01:34

swapped to my personal GitHub account. And then for the

01:36

repository name, you can just do whatever you want for

01:38

this. Like, I can say fast API

01:40

starter for AI coding. I'll just call it the exact

01:43

same thing that I'm basically cloning it from. And then

01:46

the description, I can do whatever I want. This is

01:47

just my own repository.

01:49

And then let's just say I'll make it private. I'd

01:51

recommend just making this a private at least to start.

01:53

And then you go ahead and create the repository

01:55

and then boom, you now in a couple of seconds

01:58

here have your own repository

02:00

but using the template as a starting point. So now

02:03

you can clone this into your machine

02:06

and start working on top of this. So I'll copy

02:08

the command to clone this. I've got git installed already.

02:11

It's 1 of the prereqs for the course, so I'll

02:13

do git clone and then the URL that I just

02:15

copied. There we go. And so a couple seconds later,

02:18

I can now change my directory into it, fast API

02:20

starter for AI coding. And now I can open up

02:23

any AI coding assistant I want to in this directory

02:25

and I'm off to the races with this starting point

02:27

that I can now leverage to add any features on

02:30

top. This is what we're going to be using as

02:32

the start of our Obsidian agent. And so I know

02:34

that I just cloned the template into a new folder

02:38

here, but, off camera really quick right now, I'm gonna

02:40

bring it into the Obsidian AI agent directory. So I'll

02:43

just copy over everything that I just cloned along with

02:45

the PRD that we created in the last video. So

02:48

there we go. I've got the template copied into the

02:51

Obsidian AI agent repo. You don't have to copy things

02:53

yourself. You can just work right in the template you

02:55

cloned. I'm just doing that because I have this repository

02:58

set up already. This is also where I have the

03:00

p r d and that 1 on demand context document

03:03

we created in the last video.

03:05

And so check this out. Now to validate all this

03:07

and get the template up and running, we can ask

03:10

our AI coding assistant to help us. That is the

03:13

beautiful thing with these templates or other repos that you

03:15

pull is you can always just send in a super

03:17

simple prompt like this because all repos generally will have

03:20

this read me where it has clear instructions on how

03:23

to run the application. Right? So just read the read

03:25

me, identify how to get the project up and running,

03:28

and then let me know how to get started once

03:29

you've done the analysis.

03:31

Alright. Very quickly, it got the steps laid out for

03:34

us here. Everything we need to run and validate that

03:37

the application

03:38

is working properly. And so, yeah, I'm just gonna send

03:40

in another prompt here. Run all the commands to start

03:43

the project locally. So I don't even have to understand

03:46

anything yet. I mean, I would recommend reading through the

03:49

read me as well, obviously. You should understand the template

03:52

that you're leveraging, but we can have it walk us

03:54

through getting everything set up. And so we can validate

03:57

things super quickly to get into building on top of

04:00

our template here. 1 quick interjection I have to make

04:03

is that 1 requirement for this project that I didn't

04:05

mention in the prereqs video in module 1 is a

04:08

Docker, and I would highly recommend installing Docker Desktop. So

04:11

I'll link to this in the description.

04:13

Very easy to get this installed. If you've gone through

04:15

the AI agent mastery course or most things in Dynamese

04:18

or my YouTube channel, you already have this.

04:20

Yeah. Very common developer tool, but you will need this

04:22

as well. We'll be running this AI agent as an

04:25

isolated Docker container, and that is, industry standard for creating

04:29

applications that we want to deploy to production.

04:32

So take a look at this. This is actually so

04:34

cool. It went through our read me here. It has

04:36

all the setup instructions with UV, Docker, running the migrations

04:40

in our database, starting the application, even checking the docs

04:43

and the health endpoint. It went through all of this

04:46

and it knocked it out 1 by 1. It created

04:48

my environment variables. It set up the dependencies. It built

04:51

the container, which by the way, this also includes Postgres

04:54

in the Docker Compose. So we're spinning up Postgres and

04:56

the AI agent into containers

04:58

at the exact same time. That's why you don't have

05:00

to connect a separate Postgres instance during the validation here.

05:04

And let me scroll down, and we run the migrations.

05:07

We start the application,

05:09

and then we curl,

05:10

the health endpoint and the 1 for the database as

05:13

well. So we're not just starting the application but confirming

05:15

that things are running properly. This is just so cool.

05:18

And then here's the other thing. We're going to wanna

05:21

start up this application

05:22

many times going forward. Every time we reboot our computer,

05:26

every time we make changes to the application,

05:28

and so it'd be kinda nice to turn this into

05:31

a reusable prompt, turn it into a command. This can

05:34

be a part of our system. We can have a

05:36

command to get things up and running very quickly. And

05:39

so what I'll do here is I'll say list out

05:41

all of

05:43

the commands

05:44

that you

05:45

used for this validation and running everything. Just super simple.

05:50

I wanted to boom boom boom here's a list and

05:52

then I'm going to turn this into a command.

05:54

Okay. Perfect. List out all the commands 1 by 1.

05:57

Now I can say I want to turn this into

06:00

a command and and then I'll just call out where

06:02

I want to put the reusable prompt here. So I'm

06:05

using cloud. I'll put this in dot cloud slash command

06:07

slash init dash project dot m d. For your AI

06:10

coding assistant, if it's not slash commands in particular, you

06:13

can just put this wherever you want like we talked

06:14

about with commands. And I'll say, I wanna turn this

06:17

a new command.

06:18

This command should include

06:20

very simple

06:22

instructions

06:23

for running

06:25

each of these commands

06:27

to start the project

06:29

and validate. There we go. Really nice and simple. Don't

06:31

even have to type everything correctly. So raw demonstration for

06:36

you right here. So there we go. It's gonna create

06:39

the file, come back once that is done. Perfect. Our

06:42

slash init dash project has been created and this is

06:45

what our markdown document looks like. So very concise, just

06:48

like I want. It's just all the steps laid out

06:50

very simply here. And so what I can do is

06:52

I can clear the conversation. Actually, I should restart Claude

06:55

code entirely so we load in our new slash commands.

06:58

Now I can do slash init dash project, and it's

07:00

going to go through the exact same steps, but now

07:03

I get to type a lot less. I just do

07:05

slash init project instead of, you know, typing out read

07:08

the readme, understand the commands, execute all of them, and

07:10

validate. Right now, I don't have to type out any

07:12

of that. And take a look at this. Everything looks

07:14

pretty much the same as what we ran before the

07:17

slash command, but now I had to type way less.

07:20

And so at this point, our template is set up.

07:23

We validated things and we're ready to move on to

07:26

adding in the rest of our layer 1 planning and

07:28

going to the first iteration of the PIV loop. And

07:30

so the last thing I'll do in this video is

07:32

I'll use the slash commit command that we covered in

07:35

the last module. I'm going to create a save state

07:38

of my code base here with Git because I have

07:40

my commands.

07:41

I've got my p r d. I have the launching

07:44

pad with my template. I'm ready to move into the

07:46

implementation, but I wanna have a save state. In case

07:49

anything goes wrong in the first PIV loop, I can

07:51

roll back to where I'm at right now and re

07:54

try. Alright. We got 55 files, almost 9000 lines changed

07:58

because this is the first commit with the full template.

08:01

And so now directly I can run git push, go

08:03

ahead and push these changes to the remote repo. So

08:05

I've got things ready to go into the next video

08:08

where, like I said, we'll be pulling in some of

08:10

the layer 1 planning we did in the last couple

08:12

of modules, getting into the first round of our PIV

08:16

loop.
