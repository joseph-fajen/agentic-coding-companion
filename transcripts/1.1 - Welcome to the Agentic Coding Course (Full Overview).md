Welcome to the DynaMed agentic coding course. I am beyond

00:04

excited to bring this to you. I've spent hundreds of

00:07

hours already prepping all the value that we're gonna unpack

00:10

together. Taking you from experimenting with AI coding assistance to

00:15

a Gentic coding mastery.

00:17

No matter where you're at in your journey right now

00:19

of coding or using AI coding assistance, there is a

00:22

ton of value that I have packed in for you

00:25

here. Teaching you how to build AI coding workflows as

00:29

repeatable

00:30

and reliable

00:31

systems. That's the emphasis that I have for you in

00:34

this course. So you're not just learning how to use

00:37

AI coding assistance,

00:39

which we will, of course, cover the fundamentals in the

00:41

beginning, but really teaching you how to think in systems

00:45

and delegate all of your coding to AI.

00:48

This is gonna fundamentally

00:49

shift how you're using AI coding assistance.

00:52

No matter where you're at in your journey right now,

00:54

I'm gonna unlock that new level of speed

00:56

and reliability

00:58

for you no matter what you want to create. Alright.

01:00

So let me zoom out now and give you a

01:02

bird's eye view of everything we're gonna cover in this

01:05

first video.

01:06

I want to give you a super solid overview of

01:10

the course and everything you can expect to get out

01:12

of it. And I've got this beautiful Excalidraw diagram here

01:16

to cover everything with you. And more on this in

01:18

a little bit, but I'm gonna be using these diagrams

01:20

a lot throughout the course to explain things to you

01:24

very, very clearly.

01:25

So let's start by setting the stage a little bit

01:28

here. This statistic was surprising to me when I first

01:31

read it, but 90 percent of people who build software

01:35

are already using AI coding assistance in some way. But

01:38

the problem is they have no system or a process.

01:41

They're flying pretty blindly just sending their request into the

01:44

coding assistant, maybe having a bit of a process, but

01:48

mostly just hoping for the best.

01:50

Now the thing is, out of these 90 percent of

01:53

people,

01:54

there is the 5 percent who have mastered a system

01:57

for reliable

01:58

and repeatable

01:59

AI coding workflows. And this course is going to bring

02:02

you into that top 5 percent

02:04

and probably well beyond as well. There's so much value

02:07

like I said that I have for you.

02:10

And so the goals for this course, what you will

02:12

be getting out of this is going from experimenting

02:15

to mastering

02:16

AI coding,

02:18

building production ready applications

02:20

systematically,

02:21

shipping products and features without large teams,

02:24

creating workflows that adapt to your use cases. I'm gonna

02:28

be covering mental models, not just giving you templates to

02:31

use, but actually helping you think through how to build

02:33

these systems yourself. And then finally, mastering frameworks that can

02:37

adapt to any AI tool. We're taking a step above

02:41

any individual AI coding assistant because these systems and workflows

02:44

that we create together are going to apply no matter

02:47

the tool that you use. And as we talk about

02:50

the goals that we have for this course, there are

02:52

probably some fears that are running through your mind as

02:54

well.

02:55

Am I using AI wrong? Will I fall behind the

02:57

people who master this first? Is there a better way

03:00

that I'm missing for AI coding? What if I keep

03:03

getting inconsistent

03:04

results?

03:05

These are a lot of the things that you might

03:06

be asking yourself that you're hoping to address with this

03:09

course.

03:10

And I can tell you with a hundred percent certainty,

03:13

these questions will be addressed here together.

03:17

Everything that I have compacted into this course is to

03:19

take you even from a very beginner level with AI

03:23

coding all the way to mastering a system, a workflow

03:26

that you adapt to your use case that you can

03:28

use to build anything systematically,

03:30

you're not gonna be behind. You're gonna have a competitive

03:34

advantage

03:34

being able to build anything

03:37

repeatably and reliably.

03:39

And also, you are in a very, very good hands

03:42

here. I have been using AI coding assistance every single

03:46

day for the last year.

03:48

Drinking from the fire hose of all the best

03:51

for using AI coding assistance

03:53

and refining my workflows day in and day out. And

03:55

I can say the same for Erasmus Whiting as well,

03:58

who's helping me develop this course to bring all this

04:01

value to you. And we also have been refining our

04:04

processes

04:05

together

04:06

to create this masterful set of mental models and systems

04:10

to bring to you. And we're also practitioners,

04:13

not just theorists. You can learn from all of our

04:15

mistakes,

04:16

apply all of our practical thinking right now, and through

04:19

everything we've learned. Not only do we know what the

04:22

optimal systems look like, but we also understand

04:26

how to teach you how to think about creating the

04:28

best system for your specific use case. And that's really

04:32

the power of what we're gonna be covering throughout this

04:34

whole course together. Now next up, I wanna spend some

04:37

time talking about our course structure and also defining

04:41

what it really means to build a system around AI

04:44

coding. I definitely don't want that to be a vague

04:46

idea in your mind by the time you leave this

04:49

video.

04:50

So first of all, for the course structure,

04:52

we're gonna spend most of our time in 1 of

04:55

2 places. Here at Excalidraw

04:57

for our diagramming and then in our AI coding assistant

05:02

when we are practically building things together and applying what

05:05

we're learning. So the diagrams is for the what and

05:08

the why because I really want you to understand the

05:11

principles

05:11

behind everything

05:13

that we cover together. And then, obviously, I want to

05:15

show you it all in action. That's where gonna be

05:18

in the AI coding assistant. And I'll be using Cloud

05:21

Code as my tool throughout this course, but everything that

05:24

I teach you will apply no matter the AI coding

05:27

assistant that you use, and I'll make sure to cover

05:29

how you have to tweak things depending on your tool.

05:33

And then also towards the end of the course, this

05:35

is a little bit of a teaser, but we'll be

05:37

moving beyond the terminal IDE as well, especially when we

05:41

get into remote agentic coding. And that's when we really

05:44

start to automate these workflows and systems. Very, very exciting.

05:47

More on that later, but, yeah, just a little bit

05:49

of a teaser for that. And so throughout this course,

05:52

we'll have exercises,

05:54

practical examples, and we'll be building complete systems together. Even

05:58

what we create in this course will be a template

06:01

available for you. So very engaging, a lot of resources

06:04

for you throughout everything we cover together.

06:07

And the primary

06:08

principle

06:10

that really orchestrates

06:11

everything we cover in the course

06:13

is capabilities,

06:15

not tools.

06:16

And if you have taken my AI agent mastery course

06:19

that I also have in Dynamics,

06:21

you've already heard me say this quite a few times,

06:24

and I say this in workshops and on my YouTube

06:26

channel a lot as well. When I say capabilities, not

06:28

tools,

06:29

I mean focusing on the higher leverage skills

06:33

that are going to apply no matter what you are

06:35

building specifically or what tools you're using to get the

06:38

job done. And so for the agentic coding course specifically,

06:43

learning the basics of AI coding, AKA the tools, like,

06:46

oh, here's how we do slash commands in cloud code,

06:48

or here's how we set up global rules in codex.

06:50

That's great, and we're gonna cover the fundamentals.

06:54

But the real value for you is learning how to

06:56

create your own systematic approach to using AI coding assistance

07:00

that is reliable and repeatable.

07:03

These are the true capabilities that we're gonna be focusing

07:06

on in this course. And so with the foundation laid,

07:09

we're gonna be stepping into these things that really take

07:12

you to the next level no matter what you're looking

07:15

to build, no matter what your experience level is right

07:17

now. And you already have your very first exercise coming

07:21

up quite soon here. And then after that is when

07:23

we'll really start to dive into the mental models around

07:26

creating our system.

07:28

But even before we get there, I wanna cover it

07:30

at a very high level so you get an idea

07:32

of what I am talking about.

07:34

The primary mental model that we'll be covering to begin

07:38

our system planning is the idea of planning,

07:41

then implementing,

07:42

then validating, and then iterating. So really this is a

07:45

loop here.

07:47

And so at a super high level, when you plan,

07:50

you start by exploring ideas in a very not structured

07:53

way. After you get on the same page with the

07:55

coding assistant, what you want to build, then you go

07:58

and create a super structured plan

08:01

leveraging the 4 core pillars of context engineering.

08:05

And then you use that plan to go straight into

08:08

the implementation. Now that you have a good idea of

08:11

what your goals are, success criterias, the tasks you wanna

08:14

knock out, all of this good stuff.

08:17

And then along with implementing, we also have validating, giving

08:20

you and your AI coding assistant

08:22

the tools that you need to validate the work and

08:25

iterate until a code is working perfectly.

08:28

So that is the primary mental model. And then as

08:30

far as creating systems around this, that involves quite a

08:34

few different things that we're going to cover together,

08:37

especially

08:38

turning our prompts for these different stages here

08:41

into reusable workflows that we can chain together. Leveraging tools

08:46

and MCP servers, integrating with our applications,

08:49

we can kick off these coding tasks where we need

08:51

to. There is so much that goes into this, but

08:53

I'm also gonna make the system very easy for you

08:55

to follow and implement for yourself. And we'll talk about

08:58

the core components here like our rules and our slash

09:01

commands, AKA reusable workflows. We'll cover sub agents at 1

09:04

point and how these apply to our different phases. And

09:08

then with all of that knowledge, we'll go into creating

09:11

the system together. We'll build out a full use case

09:13

in this course so you can really see it all

09:16

in action, both for working on new projects

09:18

and for working in existing projects. I'll be sure to

09:21

hit on both quite extensively in this course. And so

09:24

we're gonna get to the point where when we have

09:27

an issue in our code, instead of doing a 1

09:29

off fix, we are actually going to correct the system,

09:33

not the code. So when the AI coding assistant messes

09:37

up, we fix the system and have it retry. So

09:40

that way every time our coding assistant makes a mistake,

09:44

it is an opportunity to evolve our system. That is

09:48

the beautiful thing that we're gonna be covering here. And

09:51

then to end off the course, we'll even get into

09:53

fully remote AI coding workflows where we have something running

09:56

in the cloud, our AI coding assistant ready to receive

09:59

our requests in our applications like Gmail or Obsidian or

10:03

Notion or Asana or email, even on our phone. It

10:06

gets quite exciting at that point when we can take

10:08

our workflows and automate them to that degree. So I've

10:12

explained for the most part the schedule that we have

10:14

for this course, but I also have all of the

10:16

different release blocks

10:18

and modules laid out very clearly for you here. So

10:20

we start with the introduction, where we are right now.

10:23

We're gonna get into that first exercise very soon here,

10:26

and then I'll cover the PIV loop. That's planning, implementing,

10:29

and validating.

10:30

Basically, what I just covered, but we're going to go

10:31

into a lot of detail and really start to think

10:33

about how we can build systems around this process. Then

10:36

I've got another exercise for you, and we'll be doing

10:39

a live workshop. So the way that this course works

10:41

is we have 4 release blocks over the next couple

10:45

of months here. And every other week, there's gonna be

10:47

a live workshop to go along with the release of

10:50

that block. And so we just have a lot of

10:52

variety here in the content, both with these videos, then

10:55

we got exercises, and we have the workshops as well.

10:59

And so our first release block is the fundamentals,

11:02

then we get into our rules and reusable prompts, and

11:05

then I'll show you how we can apply all of

11:07

this to really start to build our system. And then

11:09

we have a workshop at the end of that 1.

11:12

And then we get into release block 3, which is

11:14

some of the more advanced topics, and then going beyond

11:16

the terminal. This is when we go into the cloud

11:18

and do things like remote agent decoding and integrate our

11:21

coding assistance directly in our GitHub workflows, for example.

11:25

And then the last release block, I wanna cover some

11:28

opinionated tools and frameworks. And so the PRP method, BMAD,

11:32

GitHub spec kit, these are all strategies for context engineering.

11:35

Basically,

11:36

each 1 of these, they implement the PIV loop in

11:39

their own unique way. And so these are out of

11:41

the box solutions that you can leverage right away or

11:44

learn from to evolve your own PIV loop, your own

11:48

systems. And so I wanna cover these last because I

11:51

wanna teach you from a very principled standpoint how to

11:53

build your own systems

11:55

and then showing some of these options as ones that

11:58

are already built for you. So if this plan for

12:00

the course doesn't sound good to you, I don't know

12:03

what would. Because essentially, we're breaking AI coding mastery down

12:06

into 3 parts. First, we cover the fundamentals.

12:10

So you have the mental models you need to build

12:12

your systems, then we build the systems.

12:15

And then finally, we get into more advanced topics, taking

12:19

our systems further, even automating some of these things and

12:22

integrating them into our workflows even beyond coding itself.

12:26

And so this course is perfect for you. If you

12:29

are ready to invest in building a reliable and reproducible

12:33

system to code anything with AI,

12:35

And if you believe that AI is the future of

12:38

engineering tasks, and it certainly helps if you have a

12:41

semi technical background like, you know, APIs and databases in

12:44

the command line at a high level. It's not a

12:46

requirement, but it will help. But of course, AI coding

12:49

assistance can help you, with any questions you have on

12:52

these things as well.

12:54

This course is not for you if you are super

12:57

skeptical that AI is ready to handle coding tasks

13:01

or if you want shortcuts without understanding principles. Because like

13:04

I hope I've emphasized enough here, it really is a

13:08

principled

13:09

course helping you understand not just the how, like here's

13:12

my system you can use right now, but also the

13:14

what and the why. So you can really think for

13:16

yourself and build what you need. And so if you're

13:19

an engineer, you wanna become the person that teammates ask,

13:22

how did you do that? Teach me. If you're an

13:25

entrepreneur, you wanna ship products and automations that used to

13:28

require a full team to build. If you're a technical

13:30

PM,

13:31

prototyping and validating ideas yourself, very, very powerful. Or if

13:35

you're a career switcher, accelerating your learning curve. And just

13:39

like the AI agent mastery course, that is a big

13:41

goal that I have for you no matter where you're

13:43

at, just accelerating

13:44

your learning curve. Even if you already understand the fundamentals,

13:47

you can quickly dive into building your system and the

13:50

more advanced topics, and you're still gonna get a ton

13:52

out of this course. And the primary use case that

13:55

we're gonna be building out together because, of course, we

13:57

do want something practical to apply our systems to is

14:01

a custom AI agent, an Obsidian

14:04

second brain assistant, which I am very excited for. A

14:07

lot of you in the Dynamics community have been asking

14:10

me to continue to build this out, so I'm gonna

14:12

do it as a part of the course.

14:14

And so Obsidian, if you don't know, is a completely

14:17

free and local

14:19

knowledge and note management platform I highly recommend checking out.

14:22

And because all of the files are just stored locally

14:24

as markdown, we can build an AI agent very easily

14:27

to help us manage all of our knowledge, do more

14:29

research to add things on, organize stuff for us. We're

14:32

gonna be building that as an AI agent together.

14:35

And, of course, this specific use case is not the

14:38

focus of the course. The focus is on leveraging coding

14:41

assistance and building these systems, but we need something to

14:45

show it in action, so I thought I'd go above

14:47

and beyond to build a freaking awesome use case. So

14:49

not only do you get the systems and workflows as

14:51

templates, but you also get this AI agent. This is

14:54

the primary build. There'll be some other

14:57

builds for the exercises as well. So that's the DynaMed

15:01

agent decoding course at a high level. Next up, I'll

15:04

go over some prerequisites to help you get up and

15:06

running, and then pretty soon we're gonna get into that

15:08

first exercise. You can set the stage for yourself, kind

15:12

of a self assessment

15:13

before we get into the core content. And of course,

15:16

any questions that you have at all right now or

15:19

as you go through the material, my door is always

15:22

open to you in DynaMed through DMs or through posts.

15:24

We do have a dedicated section of the community for

15:27

the agent decoding course as well. So with that, I'm

15:31

really excited to dive into mastering agent decoding with you.

15:34

So onto the next video.
