## Overview

Global rules are persistent instructions stored in configuration files (like `CLAUDE.md`) that your AI coding assistant reads at the start of every session. They establish coding conventions, architectural patterns, and behavioral guidelines.

## Principles

*Coming soon - content from Module 3: The Fundamentals of Global Rules*

## Quick Reference

- [ ] Create CLAUDE.md in project root
- [ ] Define coding conventions and style
- [ ] Specify architectural patterns to follow
- [ ] Set behavioral guidelines for the AI assistant
- [ ] Keep rules concise and actionable
