The Setup stage establishes the foundation for reliable AI-assisted development. Before writing any code, configure your environment to guide your AI coding assistant effectively.

## Topics in This Stage

- **[Context Loading](/agentic-coding-companion/01-setup/context-loading/)** - Strategies for providing relevant context to your AI assistant

## Key Principles

- Configure rules once, benefit throughout the project
