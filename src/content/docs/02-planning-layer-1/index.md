Layer 1 planning happens once per project. This is where you establish the high-level scope, create your PRD, and set up templates that will guide all subsequent development.

## Topics in This Stage

- **[Project Scope](/agentic-coding-companion/02-planning-layer-1/project-scope/)** - Define what you're building and why
- **[AI-Optimized Templates](/agentic-coding-companion/02-planning-layer-1/ai-optimized-templates/)** - Create project foundations optimized for AI assistance

## Key Principles

- Do this once per project, update rarely
- Create comprehensive PRD before implementation
- Establish templates that reduce AI assumptions
