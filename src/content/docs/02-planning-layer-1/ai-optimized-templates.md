## Overview

AI-optimized templates establish project foundations that AI coding assistants can easily understand and extend. Good templates reduce the assumptions your AI needs to make during implementation.

## Principles

*Coming soon - content from Module 5: Implementing Our AI Coding Optimized Template*

## Quick Reference

- [ ] Use clear, consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Include inline documentation for patterns
- [ ] Create example implementations for AI to follow
- [ ] Structure directories logically
- [ ] Document the "why" not just the "what"

*Placeholder content - will be populated from course transcripts in Phase 2.*
