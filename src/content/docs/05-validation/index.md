Validation ensures your implementation meets requirements and maintains code quality. This is a shared responsibility between you and your AI coding assistant.

## Topics in This Stage

- **[Validation Pyramid](/agentic-coding-companion/05-validation/validation-pyramid/)** - The layers of validation from syntax to manual testing
- **[Code Review](/agentic-coding-companion/05-validation/code-review/)** - AI-assisted and human code review practices
- **[System Review](/agentic-coding-companion/05-validation/system-review/)** - Evaluating your agentic coding system itself

## Key Principles

- AI validates syntax, types, and tests automatically
- Humans validate logic, architecture, and user experience
- Use validation findings to improve your system
