Layer 2 planning happens for every feature or task. This is where you break down the work, create a structured plan with the four pillars of context engineering, and prepare for implementation.

## Topics in This Stage

- **[Task Breakdown](/agentic-coding-companion/03-planning-layer-2/task-breakdown/)** - Decompose features into implementable tasks
- **[Planning Commands](/agentic-coding-companion/03-planning-layer-2/planning-commands/)** - Reusable commands for the planning phase

## Key Principles

- Do this for every feature, not just once
- Start with vibe planning, then structure
- Create plans that minimize AI assumptions
