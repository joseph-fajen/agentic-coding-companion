## The Agentic Coding Workflow

Follow these six stages for reliable, repeatable AI-assisted development. Each stage builds on the previous, culminating in a system that improves with every use.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="1. Setup" icon="setting">
    Configure global rules and context loading strategies. Work you do once, benefit from forever.
    [Get started](/agentic-coding-companion/01-setup/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Planning (Layer 1)" icon="document">
    Define project scope with PRDs and establish AI-optimized templates. Done once per project.

  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Planning (Layer 2)" icon="list-format">
    Break down features into structured plans using commands. Done every PIV loop.
    [Explore](/agentic-coding-companion/03-planning-layer-2/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="4. Implementation" icon="rocket">
    Execute your structured plan with the /execute command. Delegate to your AI assistant.
    [View](/agentic-coding-companion/04-implementation/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="5. Validation" icon="approve-check">
    AI handles automated testing; you perform code review and manual testing.
    [Understand](/agentic-coding-companion/05-validation/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="6. Iteration" icon="random">
    Evolve your system based on learnings. Fix the system, not just the bugs.
    [Read](/agentic-coding-companion/06-iteration/)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## The PIV Loop

The Plan-Implement-Validate loop is the core mental model for all agentic coding work:

- **Plan** - Create structured, AI-optimized plans through vibe planning then formalization
- **Implement** - Delegate execution to your AI coding assistant with the execute command
- **Validate** - AI runs automated tests; you review code and test manually
- **Iterate** - Evolve your system based on learnings, then start the next loop

Each iteration makes your system more reliable. See [PIV Loops](/agentic-coding-companion/04-implementation/piv-loops/) for the complete mental model.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **During active work** - Open the relevant stage and scan the quick reference
2. **Looking for specifics** - Use search (Ctrl/Cmd + K) to find principles or commands
3. **Learning the workflow** - Read through stages sequentially, starting with [Setup](/agentic-coding-companion/01-setup/)
4. **Building commands** - Copy code blocks directly into your `.claude/commands/` folder

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Global Rules** | CLAUDE.md or agents.md - auto-loaded every session |
| **On-Demand Context** | Reference guides loaded by commands for specific task types |
| **Structured Plan** | Feature-specific implementation plan consumed by `/execute` |
| **Commands** | Packaged workflows in `.claude/commands/` invoked with `/name` |
| **Save States** | Git commits before/after major changes for safe iteration |
