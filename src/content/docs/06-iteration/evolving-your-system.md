## Overview

System evolution is the meta-process of improving your agentic coding workflow. When you encounter bugs or friction repeatedly, the high-leverage move is to update your rules, commands, or templates to prevent recurrence.

## Principles

*Coming soon - content from Module 6: Implementing with Multiple PIV Loops & Evolving Our System*

## Quick Reference

- [ ] When bugs repeat, update global rules
- [ ] When planning feels incomplete, improve plan templates
- [ ] When validation misses issues, add to validation checklist
- [ ] Document system changes and their rationale
- [ ] Review system evolution periodically
