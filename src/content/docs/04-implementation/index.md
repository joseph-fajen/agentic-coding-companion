Implementation is where your structured plan becomes code. Using the PIV loop and execute command, your AI coding assistant works through tasks systematically while you maintain oversight.

## Topics in This Stage

- **[Execute Command](/agentic-coding-companion/04-implementation/execute-command/)** - The command that drives implementation
- **[PIV Loops](/agentic-coding-companion/04-implementation/piv-loops/)** - The Plan -> Implement -> Validate cycle

## Key Principles

- Trust but verify during implementation
- Let the AI work through the plan task by task
- Intervene only when necessary
