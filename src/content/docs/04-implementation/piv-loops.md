## Overview

The PIV loop (Plan -> Implement -> Validate) is the fundamental cycle of agentic coding. Every feature goes through this loop, and complex features may require multiple nested loops.

## Principles

*Coming soon - content from Module 2: The PIV Loop*

## Quick Reference

- [ ] **Plan**: Create structured plan with context engineering
- [ ] **Implement**: Execute the plan task by task
- [ ] **Validate**: Review code, run tests, verify acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Iterate**: Return to planning if issues found
