Welcome to your module 5 exercise, and I've already hinted

00:04

a couple of times what you're going to be doing

00:06

right now. So in your last exercise in module 4,

00:10

that is where you created your template for your structured

00:14

plans.

00:14

And so it's going to look something like this. And

00:17

this is the only thing we've been using in our

00:20

planning in module 5 as well. We had our plan

00:23

template slash command.

00:25

But your exercise right now is to add in the

00:28

research part of our planning command. So it looks more

00:31

like the planning command I covered in module 4 when

00:35

we are covering the core 4 commands.

00:38

And so you've seen this already, and I have this

00:40

as inspiration in this exercise folder that I'll link to

00:44

below as well. We still have our structured plan outlined

00:48

here. Right? Like, we have the different sections that we're

00:51

asking for when it creates that structured plan in this

00:54

folder here. But we also have this thing at the

00:56

top that outlines this entire research process.

00:59

So you have a fully complete plan when you have

01:02

both this structure of your plan defined, but then also

01:06

the research process to really finalize everything from the Vy

01:10

planning stage and putting that into the structured plan. And

01:13

so it's not like we're going to skip the Vy

01:15

planning stage. It's still important to have an unstructured conversation

01:19

and do some initial research with the coding assistant.

01:22

But during the

01:24

structured planning process,

01:26

your coding assistant will read the plan template

01:30

and it might need to do more research to fill

01:32

in some of those things. And so that's what we're

01:33

doing in a very structured way in our planning command.

01:36

And that's what I have for you for this exercise.

01:40

So the last couple of videos, the pivot loops that

01:42

we went through there, we focused on our layer 1

01:45

planning, we focused on the vibe planning and our structured

01:47

plan. But we did a lot of the research manually,

01:50

so we haven't fully built out our planning command yet

01:53

because I wanted to save it for this exercise.

01:56

And so our pattern looks pretty much like this, the

01:59

last couple of loops. We ran the prime command, that's

02:02

the beginning of our system. And as a part of

02:04

that, it reads the PRD. And so we ask, like,

02:06

what should we do next based on our PRD and

02:09

what we already have built in the code base? That's

02:11

what the priming allows us to ask. And then it

02:14

gives a recommendation, like, we should build the vault manager

02:16

or build a parent AI agent next, and we can

02:18

either agree or disagree. Like, in our first pivot that

02:21

we did, we actually disagreed, and that's totally okay. Because

02:24

based on the PRD, it understands not just its recommendation,

02:27

but these other things we might be suggesting. Like, okay.

02:30

Let's go into the Pydantic AI agent build now. And

02:33

so in Avaya Planning, we ask it to do a

02:35

bunch of research. We ask it to pull in some

02:37

of our on demand context, and then we create that

02:41

plan where we generate our structure plan

02:44

based on the template that we have in our planning

02:47

command. And this process is good. It's this is generally

02:50

what it's going to look like, but we definitely did

02:53

more research in prompting in the Vy planning stage and

02:56

we really need to. I want to build more into

02:58

the planning command. I want you to do that so

03:01

that there's just less prompting,

03:03

more systematizing.

03:05

And so we have the plan template.

03:07

I want you to turn this into a slash command

03:10

that combines

03:11

research and template filling.

03:13

And so you can call it plan dash feature,

03:16

however you want to name this command. It's going to

03:19

be an evolution of the plan dash template. And like

03:23

I said, we have this inspiration here for module 4

03:26

if you want to use this as a starting point.

03:28

So just getting a sense of, like, what can the

03:30

research process look like before I get into filling out

03:33

the template here.

03:35

And that is pretty much it for this exercise. And

03:38

so once you design your command, and it's very free

03:41

flowing here, there's no single right answer,

03:44

then you can go and test your command. This is

03:46

an optional part of the exercise, but you can go

03:48

into our Obsidian AI agent code base here. You can

03:51

call your new plan feature command, and you can ask

03:53

it to, for example, add another large language provider to

03:56

our Panent AI agents. You could use Ollama or you

03:59

could use Gemini or OpenRouter. I think that actually be

04:01

a very cool exercise. You don't have to go through

04:03

the full implementation, but having it create the structure plan,

04:07

doing a lot of research. You can do some vibe

04:09

planning upfront if you want. That's just gonna be a

04:11

good test of your command.

04:13

And so, yeah, go ahead and knock this out right

04:15

now. I really would encourage you to go through this

04:17

exercise because the planning command is 1 of the most

04:20

important ones for your system.

04:22

And so go do that and then when you come

04:23

back, I will cover my solution.

04:26

Alright. Welcome back. I hope that you got to create

04:28

a really awesome plan feature command. Now I just wanna

04:30

cover a couple of solutions here. So Rasmus made 1,

04:35

himself to help us prep for this exercise,

04:38

And then also, we used the cloud code to help

04:40

us generate a planning command. And so I just also

04:43

wanna call out that as you're creating these commands and

04:45

building your system, you can use AI coding assistance to

04:48

help you build the commands and optimize them. So I'll

04:51

show that in a little bit, but first I wanna

04:53

cover just a simple 1 that Rasmus created. So the

04:56

first thing that I wanna call out is that the

04:59

structured plan that we have as the template here,

05:02

this is exactly from our solution to the module 4

05:05

exercise. So we really are just building on top of

05:07

the plan template command,

05:09

adding in everything for research as well.

05:12

And so going back up to the top, we have

05:14

the feature through the arguments. We want to transform a

05:17

feature request into a comprehensive

05:19

implementation plan through systematic code based analysis, research, and strategic

05:23

planning. And this is gonna be, again, building on top

05:26

of anything we do in the Vybe planning stage, just

05:29

what we need to fill out our template. And so

05:31

we are not writing code in this phase. And so

05:34

going through the planning process here, this is the research

05:37

process.

05:38

We want feature understanding phase 1. Phase 2, code based

05:41

intelligence gathering. So anything that it didn't quite cover from

05:44

the priming that it needs to for this feature implementation,

05:47

we should go and do this. And then obviously, we

05:49

don't need this phase if we're starting a project from

05:52

scratch doing greenfield development, but I do want this command

05:55

to be applicable to both greenfield and brownfield. Phase 3

05:59

external research and documentation.

06:01

So gathering everything to fill out that section specifically

06:04

of our structured plan. And then deep strategic thinking. Just

06:08

making sure that our implementation plan and the task by

06:11

task that we lay out in the plan

06:13

is very well detailed. And then we generate the structured

06:16

plan. Nice and simple. And then at the very end

06:18

here, we're just saying that we wanna output it to

06:21

the plans folder. So we always wanna make sure that

06:23

the output is a markdown document. We don't want it

06:25

to just fill out the context in our conversation.

06:28

And so, yeah, that is pretty much it. It's very

06:31

simple. And overall, the different phases that we have here,

06:34

it's totally up to you. Like I said, there is

06:36

no right answer. I just think that the key takeaway

06:39

here is it is very helpful to break up the

06:41

research and planning into a few different phases that helps

06:44

you organize

06:46

the plan a hundred percent. Erasmus also created this alternative

06:49

solution as well just to show you that things can

06:51

look extremely different. It's still a completely valid command. In

06:54

this case, the template

06:56

for the structure plan is at the start. Then we

06:59

have to scroll all the way down to start getting

07:00

to the different phases here. So we totally flipped the

07:03

order of things, and that totally works as well. And

07:06

so the other thing that I wanna cover here is

07:09

Cloud Code's solution.

07:11

And so we leverage Cloud Code to help us think

07:14

through what are the different sections we should have in

07:17

this planning command. What is the optimal way to guide

07:19

a coding assistant through planning a new feature implementation for

07:23

our PIV loop? And so after a lot of back

07:24

and forth, and I don't wanna, like, show the entire

07:26

conversation or anything, Cloud Code came up with an optimal

07:29

6 phase planning process, and then it used this to

07:32

create the command that I'll show you in a second.

07:35

And so this is pretty similar to what we looked

07:37

at already with our solution, but we want to, do

07:40

understanding and scoping. And then in parallel, that's cool. That

07:43

it's thinking like, okay. What things can we actually plan

07:45

at the exact same time here? We can do the

07:47

code based intelligence gathering, like, look at our code base

07:50

and then look out to the Internet, external research and

07:52

documentation, maybe looking at examples

07:54

that we brought into our code base as well. So

07:57

very cool that we can do things in parallel. And

07:58

then phase 4, strategic design and decision making, comprehensive plan

08:02

generation,

08:03

and then making sure that the validation

08:06

and confident assessment is a part of our structure planning

08:09

as well.

08:10

So I like this. I think this is really solid

08:12

and you can tell that this is a document generated

08:14

by a coding assistant because of how freaking long it

08:17

is, but that is totally okay.

08:19

Because this is just more for demonstration purposes that I

08:21

wanna show you how we can use a coding assistant

08:23

to think through something optimal in a process and then

08:27

document that in a command to build it into our

08:29

system. And so going to the command here, it's going

08:32

to look very similar to Rasmus's solution. So we have

08:35

the feature request through arguments.

08:37

Our purpose is to, I mean, pretty much the same,

08:40

transform into a comprehensive implementation ready plan. We have our

08:44

structure for the structured plan.

08:47

Looks really nice and concise. And then we have the

08:49

different phases based on its recommendation.

08:51

So there we go. All 6 phases laid out here.

08:55

And so use these as inspiration.

08:57

You completed the exercise already. You have your plan, feature,

09:00

command, but maybe there are some sections that Claude Coates

09:03

suggested or Rasmus has in his solution that you think

09:05

would be really nice to include. Go ahead and do

09:07

that. Use this exercise

09:09

as a chance to evolve your system already before you

09:11

even get into the coding. So that is everything that

09:14

we got for this exercise.

09:16

Keep this command handy because we're gonna be using the

09:19

plan feature command going into module 6 because when we

09:22

focus on implementation,

09:24

we already have this built. We're gonna go pretty quickly

09:26

through the planning part of things in the next module.

09:29

And so I will see you there. We're gonna go

09:30

through the PIV loop a couple more times adding the

09:33

tools to our Obsidian agent.
