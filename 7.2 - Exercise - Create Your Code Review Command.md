Welcome to your first exercise on creating your validation system.

00:04

Your task here is to create a command to perform

00:06

a comprehensive code review on your project.

00:09

You can think of it like a command to help

00:11

you with the code review part of the human validation

00:15

at the very end of the PIV loop, or you

00:17

could use this as a command to do a code

00:20

review after many iterations of a PIV loop, or you're

00:22

jumping into a code base for the first time and

00:24

you want to perform an audit. It really is up

00:27

to you how you create this command. It can be

00:29

fit for many different purposes. So you can think of

00:32

the code review command kind of like the prime command.

00:35

We're doing an overarching analysis of the code base, but

00:38

instead of gathering context

00:40

specifically like the prime command, we are looking for issues

00:44

in the code base. Logic errors, security vulnerabilities, performance issues,

00:48

code smells and anti patterns, literally anything that you wanna

00:51

be on the lookout for. You can put that in

00:53

this command to run it to help you perform reviews

00:56

after individual PIV loops or even beyond that. And just

00:59

for a little bit of inspiration, Anthropic uses their code

01:02

review command for the first pass on every single pull

01:05

request. This is part of their validation gate. Before they

01:08

merge any pull request, they are running this code review

01:11

command. It's probably a very comprehensive process that they have

01:15

set up here. So I'm not expecting you to make

01:17

something

01:18

extremely elaborate in this exercise, but I want you to

01:21

think about a couple of things here. What do you

01:23

want the agent to see as it's looking for issues?

01:26

What do you want the agent to do? Right? Like,

01:28

what kinds of issues in particular

01:30

do you want the agent to be on the lookout

01:32

for? Do you want them to focus on security vulnerabilities,

01:34

on performance issues, all of the above, and just be

01:37

a jack of all trades? Think about that. What do

01:40

you want the agent to output back to you when

01:42

the review is done? So just like every command, we

01:45

wanna think about what's the structure of the output and

01:47

who is it targeted for. Is it for us to

01:50

review the issues or is it for another agent to

01:52

address them? Think about that as you're creating the command.

01:55

And then for even more inspiration, I have an example

01:59

solution for you to reference. And so there is no

02:02

right answer here, and that really has been the theme

02:05

for all the exercises in this course. So much so

02:07

where I'm giving you the solution that I'll cover

02:10

after you have your stab at it. So you can

02:12

review this if you want to take inspiration. But if

02:15

you really wanna make it yourself from scratch, don't go

02:18

off of this and then maybe just improve your code

02:21

review command once I cover the solution with you. The

02:24

1 thing that I do wanna call out that is

02:26

pretty interesting you might wanna consider is that as a

02:28

part of our code review command, we are using git

02:31

commands

02:32

to list out the recent changes on our code base.

02:35

Like maybe this is right after a pivot loop before

02:37

we ran the commit command in our system so it

02:40

can look at exactly what was changed without us having

02:43

to tell it explicitly. So that's just 1 interesting idea

02:46

for you to incorporate if you want. We can take

02:48

advantage of git like we are for a lot of

02:50

parts of our system.

02:52

And so with that, go ahead and take a stab

02:54

at it. And you can even test this command yourself

02:57

by going through a PIV loop and then running this

02:59

at the end of a PIV loop before you make

03:01

a commit. Because remember, the commit is always for once

03:03

we are done with our validation.

03:05

This is a part of our validation. So go create

03:07

your code review command right now. I'm not providing too

03:10

much guidance because this is really free form. And then

03:12

once you come back, I'll go over my code review

03:15

implementation.

03:16

Welcome back. Hope that you have a really solid code

03:19

review command. Now I just wanna go over my solution.

03:22

And please feel free to take any of the ideas

03:24

here that I presented to add into your code review

03:28

command.

03:29

You can always use the resources that I give you

03:32

in this course to evolve your system before you even

03:35

use it a lot. That's 1 of the big benefits

03:37

to going through the DynaMed agent decoding course. And so

03:41

I have the solution in the folder for this exercise,

03:44

but then also in the dot agents commands validation folder

03:48

that that I called out in the last video. I

03:50

also have the same code review command right here. And

03:52

then also the command to fix based on the code

03:55

review report. That's we're gonna get into in the next

03:58

video. So just a bit of a teaser for what's

04:00

coming up next year. So we have our core principles,

04:03

and then we have what to review. And when you

04:05

read through this, this looks very much like the start

04:09

of our priming command. Like I said, it is really

04:11

similar be because we have to gather context on the

04:14

code base before we go through the rest of the

04:16

process.

04:17

And if you wanted to, you could even instead of

04:20

having a brief set of priming instructions here, you could

04:23

tell it to call the prime command if you wanted

04:25

to do that. That's another way that you could improve

04:28

this command

04:29

or just do something a bit different. Because when we

04:32

do our comprehensive code review here, I generally do recommend

04:35

doing it in a brand new context window. So the

04:38

flow will generally go go through your planning, new conversation,

04:42

do the implementation,

04:43

do some of your validation, and, you know, ask the

04:46

questions you need to, then new conversation again, do a

04:49

comprehensive code review. And so that's why we have to

04:52

do the priming. And then as a part of our

04:54

priming, we're also

04:55

leveraging git. Because if we did this at the end

04:58

of a pivot loop before we commit, then we're able

05:00

to look at the different files that are changed and

05:03

added. Like I mentioned before,

05:05

you went off and did the exercise. And so I

05:07

think this is a really important part to the command

05:09

that's why I'm calling it out again. And then for

05:11

each of the change files or new files, so we're

05:14

kind of looping over all of the changes here. We

05:17

wanna look for logic errors, security issues, calling out specific

05:20

examples of each, performance problems. You could add in as

05:23

many sections as you want here. Or if you wanna

05:26

make it more of a security specific code review, then

05:28

maybe you would just have security issues. You make it

05:31

hyper focused and then have more context to expand upon

05:34

the different things you're looking for. So you can specialize

05:36

this code review command if you want as well. I'm

05:38

just trying to give you a ton of ideas for

05:40

how you can really customize your system, evolve it, and

05:43

build on top of what we have here. I'm just

05:45

making this 1 a more general code review command. And

05:48

then for the output format, I'm saving it to a

05:50

new code review folder that I wanna have in my

05:53

dot agent. So my entire AI layer, I really am

05:55

trying to store as much as I possibly can in

05:57

dot agents. So just another example of how we can

06:00

incorporate more context there. And so we have whatever name

06:03

it decides for the markdown here as this code review

06:06

file, and it's going to be nice and structured here

06:09

so that we can validate it ourself. And then later,

06:12

which I'll show you in the next video, we can

06:14

give this as context to the code review fix command

06:17

as well. So there you go. That is my solution

06:20

for the code review command.

06:22

And so with that, we're gonna go into the next

06:25

video where I'll show you this in action. We'll go

06:28

back to the last PIV loop we did in the

06:30

previous video, and in a brand new conversation, we'll perform

06:33

the code review. We'll take a look at everything

06:35

that we implemented, if there's any issues that we should

06:38

address, and then I'll show you what it looks like

06:40

to address the issues based on the code review report

06:43

as well.
