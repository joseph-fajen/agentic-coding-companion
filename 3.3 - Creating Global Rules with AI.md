Okay. Time to answer the last big question you might

00:02

have, then you're ready to go on to the next

00:04

exercise where you'll be working with global rules and the

00:07

rest of layer 1 planning directly.

00:09

And that big question is, how the heck do I

00:12

build my global rules? And what I mean by that

00:15

specifically is at this point, you might be like, okay.

00:18

I totally understand some of the core sections I should

00:21

have, like my architecture and code style and tech stack,

00:25

but how do I fill in the details here? Like,

00:27

I might know a couple of these things, but, like,

00:29

it's so specific. There's so much text here. I mean,

00:32

like, this global rule example I gave you is almost

00:34

300 lines long. So how could you possibly expect me,

00:38

Cole, to write that all out? And here's the big

00:42

sigh of relief. You don't have to write this all

00:44

out. You can use an AI coding assistant

00:47

to help you with all of the details that you're

00:50

looking at in the global rules. And so that's what

00:53

I wanna show you how to do in this video.

00:55

I have a couple of prompts that you can use.

00:57

Just paste right into your coding assistant where it basically

01:01

is a process that'll walk you through creating both your

01:03

global rules. That's the first prompt that I have here.

01:07

And then also your reference guides, the task types or

01:10

the on demand context. So 2 different prompts to help

01:13

you with both. And the important thing here is please

01:16

don't just vibe code your layer 1 planning. You need

01:19

to be a part of this process and review everything

01:22

meticulously,

01:23

especially because your layer 1 planning is the foundation for

01:27

all code that will be created by the coding assistant

01:30

in your code base going forward. And so you wanna

01:32

make sure this is rock solid. And so my advice

01:35

here and kind of what I've built into these prompts

01:37

is I want you to describe the higher level details

01:40

around the tech stack and architecture and things like that.

01:43

And then you're just leveraging the AI coding assistant to

01:46

fill in the details so that you can have a

01:48

very robust

01:49

set of global rules here without it having to be

01:52

you typing line by line all 200 or 300 or

01:55

500 lines or whatever it might be for your global

01:58

rules. And so the first prompt that I have here

02:00

and like in this video, I'm just gonna walk you

02:02

through both of the prompts quickly and just how they

02:04

work at a high level.

02:06

The first prompt is the 1 to create your rules.

02:08

And so you can just copy,

02:10

from right below where it says prompt begins here. So,

02:12

like, you copy right here all the way to the

02:14

bottom, and you can just paste this directly into your

02:17

AI coding assistant in a brand new conversation.

02:20

Because essentially, this prompt defines a workflow, which this could

02:23

be a command by the way, which again we'll talk

02:26

about in the next module more. But it defines a

02:28

workflow where it's going to walk you through setting up

02:31

your global rules no matter if it is a brand

02:34

new project or an existing project. And I call out

02:37

these sections

02:39

specifically

02:40

that we should have in the global rules

02:42

at the end of this command.

02:44

And so, again, just following the general sections I recommend.

02:49

You could always tweak this if you want.

02:51

But honestly, if you wanna leverage this resource that I

02:53

have for you as a part of the course, just

02:55

use this prompt and then iterate on the global rules

02:57

after. I'm not expecting it to be perfect for your

03:00

use case just when you're using this prompt. But, basically,

03:03

here's the process for existing projects. It's gonna analyze the

03:06

code base, and it's going to extract architecture and tech

03:09

stack and things like that. And then for a new

03:11

project, it's gonna ask you questions because there's nothing for

03:14

it to work on yet. And so it needs to

03:16

know what your idea is and anything that you know

03:19

about the tech stack you wanna use, and then it'll

03:21

research the web to find best practices, for example. And

03:24

then it'll create the global rules from that. Then I've

03:26

just got some critical requirements, things like making sure the

03:29

global rules are actually concise. And so, yeah, let's actually

03:32

see this in action. I'm going to copy this right

03:35

now and then go over to my coding assistant in

03:37

a brand new conversation.

03:39

Okay. So over in cloud code, I sent in this

03:41

full prompt and this is a brand new project. You

03:44

can see I have no code. So it goes down

03:46

the path in the process

03:48

where it's gonna ask me clarifying questions to figure out

03:50

the type of project that I'm building, if there's any

03:52

ideas I have already of things like the language or

03:55

frameworks or a database preference. And so I'm gonna answer

03:59

all this and come back. I'm just showing you a

04:01

really basic example here of leveraging this prompt. And, of

04:03

course, you can always just ditch this prompt and make

04:07

up your own kind of process for establishing the rules

04:09

with your coding assistant. I'm just giving you a resource

04:12

to use if you want. Alright. So I gave it

04:14

very basic answers to all of its questions since this

04:16

is just a demo. And there's no code to analyze

04:19

here. It's a new project, so it's doing web research

04:22

instead on best practices around the different things I called

04:24

out for my tech stack, like fast API

04:27

and Chad CN for the front end. And boom, there

04:30

is our claw dot MD

04:31

450 lines. So it's within the maximum that I gave

04:34

and the prompt that you have now. And it even

04:37

gives me a summary of the sections that it created.

04:39

So very cool. And we can go into our actual

04:41

cloud dot m d, see what it looks like. So

04:43

we got our core principles,

04:45

our tech stack. Everything's aligned with the answers I gave

04:49

to its questions for the back end and the front

04:51

end. We have the architecture, like, the code base. And

04:54

I know I haven't begun the project yet, but it's

04:56

kinda cool that it, like, outlines, like, for this kind

04:59

of application, here's generally what your code base would look

05:01

like. And then this is the kind of thing that

05:02

you would definitely want to refine

05:05

as you are actually building out your project. Right? Like,

05:07

we don't change our global rules much, but we still

05:10

do evolve them as we build out our code.

05:13

And this is a really good example of the kind

05:14

of thing that we probably would change at some point,

05:17

but a lot of this is going to remain

05:20

pretty much the same. And so use this prompt if

05:22

you want, go through your own process, get to the

05:25

point where you have a global rules, and then iterate

05:27

on things. Make sure that the code style is actually

05:29

your code style. The tech stack is your tech stack.

05:32

And if you're not as comfortable with coding and you

05:35

don't really have opinions or ideas on these things, then

05:38

it's okay to lean more on the LLM, but just

05:40

make sure you ask it questions so you understand different

05:43

options and everything that is deciding here in your layer

05:47

1 planning. Okay. So that was our global rules. Now

05:49

I wanna go through a similar process with you for

05:52

our second prompt here. This time, it is for our

05:55

on demand context, our

05:57

reference guides that we have for the specific task types.

06:01

And so it's the same kind of deal here where

06:02

you can copy everything from, what's right below prompt begins

06:06

here to the end of the file. However, there are

06:09

2 things that I want you to fill in here

06:11

because we need some kind of starting point to help

06:14

us gather some best practices to create a guide on

06:17

this specific task type. And so you can search the

06:20

web in any way to find best practices for whatever.

06:23

You can use an LLM to help, like, literally do

06:25

this however you want. It's super flexible. For my example

06:28

here, let's say that I want to build a reference

06:30

guide on creating new API endpoints into my project.

06:34

Basically, I want to gather some best practices from the

06:37

Internet and then combine it with my own ideas or

06:41

my existing code base if I have 1. And so

06:43

I'm literally just gonna go to Google and say fast

06:46

API

06:47

best practices. There we go. And I already searched this,

06:49

so fast API best practices. And then take a look

06:51

at this. We got this URL right here. I obviously

06:54

tested this before recording. And so we have this GitHub

06:57

repo that literally gives us all these best practices

07:00

around building API endpoints with fast API. So we're not

07:03

just, like, copying this entire thing, though you could actually

07:06

do that. Like, if you find this really solid set

07:08

of best practices, you could use that directly as your

07:11

on demand context. But what I wanna show you here

07:15

is how we can kind of build this into a

07:17

process where I have this prompt now that I fill

07:19

in, like, a guide for building,

07:23

fast API endpoints,

07:25

or I should say for creating fast API endpoints, and

07:28

I'll paste in a link here. Because now it's going

07:30

to leverage this, but then also my own custom process

07:33

to analyze my code base, ask me clarifying questions, kinda

07:36

like what we did when we created our global rules.

07:38

And so it's just something a bit more custom to

07:41

us based on an online resource. And so I'm gonna

07:44

copy this, and now I'm gonna go back into my

07:47

conversation. I did a clear here, so we're starting from

07:49

scratch. I'm just gonna go ahead and paste this in,

07:52

and I'll come back once it is done with the

07:54

initial turn. And there we go. Just a couple of

07:57

minutes later and we have our reference document, our on

08:00

demand context. And this was a very basic example because

08:04

there was no existing code to analyze. So pretty much

08:07

just read the best practices and went right into creating

08:10

my on demand context. So this is a lot more

08:13

useful on an existing code base, but still pretty cool

08:15

that we have this created now for a coding assistant

08:18

to follow every time it creates API endpoints going forward.

08:21

But, yeah, for an existing code base, this is really

08:24

nice because it'll take the best practices

08:27

and kind of combine that with what we have set

08:29

up already to tune

08:31

the guide to our code base specifically.

08:34

And so, yeah, now we have this guide on creating

08:36

fast API endpoints

08:38

following the whole structure that I have defined in that

08:40

second prompt that I have for you here. And you

08:41

can just tweak this to your heart's content however you

08:44

want.

08:45

And the last important thing that I wanna communicate with

08:47

you here is that not only do our global rules

08:51

and reference documents

08:52

guide our AI coding assistant, kind of instructing it on

08:56

what to do, but also it helps keep things consistent.

09:00

And I think that's especially important to say because a

09:02

lot of these things, the coding assistant probably already understands.

09:06

Like, it knows how to define schemas.

09:09

Or going to our global rules, like, it knows different

09:12

code styles and it understands that it should be writing

09:14

unit tests and integration tests and things like that. But

09:17

it's more about defining exactly how we want to do

09:20

those things just to make everything

09:22

very

09:23

consistent in our code base. Then, of course, it also

09:25

helps the AI coding assistant to have those guiding principles

09:28

as well. And so, yeah, it is so important to

09:31

dedicate a lot of time to layer 1 planning. Because

09:33

like I said earlier, this is the foundation for everything

09:36

you create going forward. And so if you skimp on

09:39

this right now, it's just gonna take longer to build

09:42

everything in the future when you're implementing your system for

09:45

AI coding. And so that's the last call to action

09:48

I have before going into the next exercise here is,

09:50

like, really take all this to heart and work on

09:53

your next project. Like, right now, you can go and

09:55

work on the layer 1 planning. Build your rules. Build

09:58

your references.

09:59

You can use these prompts that I gave you here

10:01

or just take the principles that I just taught you

10:03

and build up your own process.

10:05

Totally up to you. I would encourage either way. So

10:08

there you go. That is the fundamentals of global rules.

10:11

And you're gonna be seeing a lot more of layer

10:13

1 planning in action in a couple of modules from

10:16

now and in the rest of the course. And so

10:18

if anything's not crystal clear right now, just 1, poke

10:21

around with this with your coding assistant and keep asking

10:24

questions to help you build your rules and on demand

10:27

context. And then 2, feel free to ask me any

10:29

questions in the Dynamics community. And then third, there's gonna

10:33

be so many more times for you to see all

10:35

this in action to make it really concrete in the

10:38

rest of the course. And so with that, on to

10:40

our next exercise where I'm going to give you a

10:44

bloated global rules, and it's your job to figure out

10:47

what belongs in the global rules, what belongs in on

10:49

demand context, and then what is redundant and should be

10:52

removed. And so this exercise is also going to keep

10:54

making things even more concrete for you. So I'll see

10:57

you in the next video where I'll cover that.
